# nRF52832DevBoard

This is a collection of sketches that can be run on the nRF52832 Development Board available [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/nrf52832-development-board/). The sketches use Sandeep Mistry's Arduino core and BLEPeripheral API to read sensor data and display it to smart devices via services and characteristics. The development board can be flashed using the J-Link debugger found on the nRF52 DK. This is not as convenient as programming via the USB connector but this is the easiest way to start using BLE I have found.
